# Soda-fountain

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in **soda-fountain**, a static site build system that is based on **Gulp**, **Metalsmith** and assorted plugins. **soda-fountain** is built with the following design principals in mind.

- Static build systems should be based on well documented, open source tools and technologies.

- Static build systems should provide you all the necessary tools to create a site from conception to deployment.

- Static build systems should be modular, allowing you to add, remove and configure components as you see fit.

To achieve these goals, Soda-fountain makes ample use of Gulp, the most popular and well documented streaming build system on the web and Metalsmith, a rising star in the world of Static Site Generators. Both tools provide a rich ecosystem of plugins that makes creating the website you want a snap.

With Soda-fountain and a little know-how, it's possible to create anything from simple blogs and portfolios to larger, data-driven sites that resemble a more traditional CMS.
