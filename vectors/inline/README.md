#Welcome to the Inline Directory

This is where inline SVGs are stored. Inline SVGs are typically used on individual pages for illustrations or infographics. SVGs in this folder are optimized and sent off to the ```images``` directory, where they can be referenced with an ```<img>``` tag or included in a jade template.
