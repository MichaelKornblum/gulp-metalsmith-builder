Greetings, salutations and welcome to my blog. My name is Michael Kornblum and in this blog I intend to share my thoughts, feelings and observations as the pertain to Linux, open source software, web design and front-end development.

Now, let me tell you a little about myself:

For the past seven or so years, learning web design and front-end development has been an all encompassing passion. I can't even begin to count the number of books, blog posts, video tutorials and podcasts I have consumed in an effort to learn more about my craft. Whenever a new technology starts to become "a thing", I'm all about learning what it does, and how it can be of value to me.

With this being said, I have a little confession to make. This is my first personal website. I realize that this fact may raise a few eyebrows among my friends, collegues and peers, but the truth of the matter is that I was scared of putting my own website up for public scrutiny and possible critique.

Imposter syndrome is not uncommon among those in skilled professions. I've written articles for LinkedIn, established a small presence on Github and even taught Responsive Web Design to others. But with each bit of knowledge that I shared, the nagging voice that cast doubt upon my own personal abilities grew louder and louder. Finally, something had to give.

Recently, I asked myself if I still wanted to be a Web Designer or front-end developer, or if I was going to continue on as a hobbyist. If my passion was to become a career, I had to have a personal site online whether it was perfect of not. This meant that I had to check my neurosis and perfectionism at the door, and in the words of Chris Coyier "just build websites."

With this mantra firmly in mind, I build this blog from scratch using the Metalsmith static site generator, and the Gulp streaming build system. The original intention was to create something that was virtually indistinguishable from a WordPress theme, but could be easily hosted on Github pages. Thus far, I'm about three quarters of the way complete with the template. But I decided to go live with this project regardless of its level of completion for a couple of reasons.

First, by working out in the open, I'm taking the focus off myself and thinking of those who are actually visiting my site. Secondly, by chronicling the lessons I learn while finishing this blog, I can hopefully help others.

Now, what do I need to do before I call this blog a finished product?

- Create an About page.
- Add some kind of provision for reader comments.
- Add contact information.
- Create a finished Archive page.
- Add SVGs to the navigation area.
- Fix issuse with image aliasing.
- Clean up CSS.

For the time being, this is my "to do list." I suspect that as I complete one task, others will start to rear their heads. These in turn will also need to be documented and resolved. But for now, this is what I have.

Please check back, and I will keep you posted on how this blog is progressing. I hope to hear from you soon. And in the meantime, build something awesome.
