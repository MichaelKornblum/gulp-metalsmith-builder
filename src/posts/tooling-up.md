A couple of years ago, I wrote an article called *Tooling Up: My Web Design and Development Rig for Ubuntu 14.04.* Not a lot has changed in my current set up. Ubuntu continues to be my OS of choice and I still use GIMP, Inkscape and Agave for most of my graphic editing. But my old blog is no longer in existence, and nowadays there are enough changes to my workflow that I felt it was time to revisit this topic.

### My Desktop Environment: Gnome 3.16 ###

Changing desktop environments is never easy. I discovered this a few years ago when the Gnome project decided to toss their entire codebase and rebuild their desktop from the ground up. The change to the Gnome environment was so significantly alien that it sent me running and screaming to the KDE camp.

I was happy with my choice of desktop up until recently, when KDE switched from version four to five. The new version was so buggy that I found it to be unusable. So once again, I was in search of a new desktop. Ironically, after a five year absence I returned to Gnome and found it to be just what I was looking for.

In some ways, I think my choice in desktop environments has been influenced by my increasing use of Mac OSX. One of the main reasons I chose Gnome was because out of all the Linux desktops out there, it seemed to most closely resemble a complete product, but was still customizable enough to fit my needs. Additionally, its design is minimalistic enough to
get out of my way when I have coding to do.

### My Graphic Editing Suite: GIMP, Inkscape & Agave
For photo editng, scalable vector graphic creation and color scheme generation GIMP, Inkscape and Agave continues to be my tools of choice. However there are times when I have no choice but to reach for my Macbook and fire up Photoshop or Illustrator. Usually this occurs when I have to use a feature that is not present in GIMP or Inkscape, or if I'm collaborating with others who are still stuck in the Creative Cloud.

Additionally, my usage of GIMP has fallen off
