A couple of years ago, I wrote an article called *Tooling Up: My Web Design and Development Rig for Ubuntu 14.04.* Not a lot has changed in my current set up. Ubuntu continues to be my OS of choice and I still use GIMP and Inkscape for most of my graphic editing. But my old blog is no longer in existence, and nowadays there are enough changes to my workflow that I felt it was time to revisit this topic.

### My Desktop Environment

Changing desktop environments is never easy. I discovered this a few years ago when the Gnome project decided to toss their entire codebase and rebuild their desktop from the ground up. The change to the Gnome environment was so significantly alien that it sent me running and screaming to the KDE camp.

I was happy with my choice of desktop up until recently, when KDE switched from version four to five. The new version was so buggy that I found it to be unusable. So once again, I was in search of a new desktop. Ironically, after a five year absence I returned to Gnome and found it to be just what I was looking for.

In some ways, I think my choice in desktop environments has been influenced by my increasing use of Mac OSX. One of the main reasons I chose Gnome was because out of all the Linux desktops out there, it seemed to most closely resemble a complete product, but was still customizable enough to fit my needs. Additionally, its design is minimalistic enough to get out of my way when I have coding to do.

### My Text Editor
Up until a year ago Sublime Text was my text editor of choice. But the idea of using a proprietary application when there are literally tons of open source text editors out there just didn't feel right to me. After trying out numerous alternatives I finally settled on Atom, the open source text editor from the folks at Github.

As far as I'm concerned Atom is the best open source text editor out there. Recent updates to the project has increased its speed and performance, and its feature-set comfortably rivals those of Sublime Text. Additionally, its rich eco-system of plugins covers everything from support for various programming languages, to Emmet preprocessing and much more. As a result, my transition from Sublime Text to Atom was painless and did not result in any substancial loss of productivity.

### My Graphic Editing Suite
For photo editng and scalable vector graphics, GIMP and Inkscape continues to be my tools of choice. However there are times when I have no option but to reach for my Macbook and open up Photoshop or Illustrator. Usually this occurs when I have to use a feature that is not present in GIMP or Inkscape, or if I'm collaborating with others who are still stuck in the Creative Cloud.

Of these applications, I have found my use of GIMP has decreased over time while my use of Inkscape has increased. This is due to the fact that I've been using more scalable vector images in my work, and have confined my use of jpegs and pngs to more photographic content.

The one tool I have yet to mention is Agave, a color scheme generator for the Linux desktop. While I still use the application from time to time, I have recently found myself using online tools like [Palettton](http://colorschemedesigner.com/) for the majority of my color scheming.  One advantage that Paletton has over Agave is that it lets me preview my color schemes on an example website. Additionally, I can export my color schemes to a CSS file.

With this being said, I have no plans to totally banish Agave from my workflow, especially since its color picker comes in very handy. But I think my choice in color schemers shows just how my philosophy towards open source software has changed. No longer do I ask myself if an application just works on Linux. Instead I ask if I can use the same application across multiple operating systems.
